# Zentix Valentine No-Escape Link ❤️

This is a fun, viral marketing web page designed for Zentix. It features a "Will you be my Valentine?" question where the "NO" button is impossible to click!

## Features

- **Prank Logic**: The "NO" button runs away when you try to click or touch it.
- **Success Celebration**: Clicking "YES" triggers a confetti explosion and a branded success message.
- **Zentix Branding**: "Powered by Zentix" footer to spread brand awareness.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop.

## How to Run Locally

1. Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
2. Or serve it using a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code).

## How to Deploy for Free (Viral Strategy)

To make this go viral, you need a live link (e.g., `valentines.zentix.lk` or a free URL).

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Free)

1. Create a repository on GitHub (e.g., `zentix-valentine`).
2. Upload these files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
3. Go to Settings > Pages > Select `main` branch > Save.
4. Share the link!

### Option 2: Netlify (Free & Fast)

1. Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2. Drag and drop this folder onto the page.
3. You will get a live link instantly!
4. You can rename the site to something like `zentix-love.netlify.app`.

## Customization

- **Images**: Replace the GIF in `index.html` with a custom Zentix mascot or stick to the cute bear.
- **Text**: Edit the messages in `index.html` to fit your specific tone.
